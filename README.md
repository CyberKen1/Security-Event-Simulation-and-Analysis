# Security Event Simulation and Analysis

## Objective
The project focused on generating and analyzing security events using Nmap on Kali Linux. It aimed to enhance hands-on skills in security incident detection, querying SIEM systems, and improving overall network security monitoring.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of network security event simulation.
- Proficiency in querying and interpreting data within Elastic SIEM.
- Enhanced threat detection and analysis skills.
- Experience in using penetration testing tools for simulated attack patterns.

### Tools Used
- **Nmap** for network scanning and event generation.
- **Kali Linux** as the primary environment for testing and analysis.
- **Elastic SIEM** for log ingestion, querying, and incident analysis.
